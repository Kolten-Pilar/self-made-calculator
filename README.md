This project was heavily influenced by the calculator code-along. I tried to update the button functions by writing my own equals button function and clear button function.

I also have better understanding of the DOM. I manipulated the DOM by using the getElementById to show the results in the div with class and ID 'showCalculation'. I noticed that when trying getElementByClassName it wouldn't show the output but with getElementById it would. I tried to change it because the code-along was querySelectorAll and I needed to practice DOM manipulation.

I added event listeners for click on all buttons. When I comment this out, the buttons still work except for equals and clear so I am trying to figure that out.
